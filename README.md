Combining the power of [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) and [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) will allow you to index your files on the browser on Cloudflare Workers.

## ‚ú® Unique Features
- üïí Modified time displaying issue on Safari browser and browsers on iOS has been fixed

## ‚ö° Features


## üìã TODO
 - [ ] Adding all expected tasks to the to-do list
 - [ ] Adding Plyr video player (almost completed)
 - [ ] Implementing service accounts feature

## üìñ Wiki
**_Note: The Wiki will be added soon. Until then, you can check this out: [https://dudoo.me/wikis](https://dudoo.me/wikis).  
If you are comfortable reading comments in the code, here you go: [goindex-extended/index.js](https://github.com/cheems/goindex-extended/blob/master/index.js). (Note: Don't edit the code after the [line:123](https://github.com/cheems/goindex-extended/blob/master/index.js#L123) unless you need to develop.)_**

## üöÄ Quick Deployment
**_Note: If you need the latest version, use index.js, which is in the root of the repo: [goindex-extended/index.js](https://github.com/cheems/goindex-extended/blob/master/index.js)._**
- **_The Latest version of index.js will be added to the generator soon. Until then, you can use the generator for creating auth credetials, and then you can add them manually to the latest code which you can get from the file mentioned above._**
1. Open the below Colab notebook in a new tab  
   [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cheems/goindex-extended/blob/master/template/GoIndex_Extended_Code_Generator_with_rclone_credentials.ipynb)
2. Fill the fields in it on your choice and run the cell
3. Download the txt file with the code generated by the notebook
4. Deploy the code to [Cloudflare Workers](https://www.cloudflare.com/)
5. If you added any folder to the index and you want the search function to work with folders as well, then check this out: [Configure Search Functionality for Folders](https://github.com/cheems/goindex-extended#-configure-search-functionality-for-folders)

## üïπ Deployment

1. Go enable [Google Drive API](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/drive.googleapis.com)
2. Create a new project or use one of the existing projects if you already have created. (If you are using Google Cloud Platform for the 1st time: do this only if you want to give your project a custom name. otherwise, your project will be automatically created after the next step with the name "My First Project". If you don't care about the name of the project like me then just skip this step)
3. Click Enable button to enable Google Drive API
4. Click Create Credentials
5. Select "Google Drive API" from the 1st dropdown and select "Other UI" from the 2nd dropdown
6. Select "User data" from radio buttons
7. Click "What credentials do I need" then, a pop-up will appear saying that you need to set up the Consent Screen.
8. click "set up consent screen". it will take you to a new tab
9. Select "External" as the user type and click create
10. Provide app name, User support email, and developer contact information which are required for the consent screen. then finish creating the consent screen.
11. After creating the consent screen, click publish app. (This option can be found under Publishing status)
12. Head back to the previous tab to continue creating credentials
13. Click on refresh and create OAuth client ID then click Done
14. Click on newly created OAuth Client ID to see client id and secret
15. Open the below Colab notebook(which is made for the ones who wish to use their own credentials) in a new tab  
    [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cheems/goindex-extended/blob/master/template/GoIndex_Extended_Code_Generator_with_custom_credentials.ipynb)
16. Copy your client id and client secret into the Colab notebook and fill the fields in it on your choice and run the cell
17. Download the txt file with the code generated by the notebook
18. Deploy the code to [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)
19. If you added any folder to the index and you want the search function to work with folders as well, then scroll down a bit and check the below section

## üîé Configure Search Functionality for Folders
**_If you added any folder to the index and you want the search function to work with folders as well, then the below steps need to be followed. Otherwise, the Search function will not be worked properly._**

**_Note: If you didn't add any folder ids to the roots section in your index, then you don't need to go through this._**

1. Open the following Colab notebook in a new tab  
   [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cheems/goindex-extended/blob/master/generators/Folder_Id_List_Generator.ipynb#scrollTo=vdf8HtfeVHPc)
2. Run the cell which is highlighted; then a text box will be appeared
3. Copy the entire index code from your Worker in Cloudflare and paste it into the provided text box
4. Then this notebook will generate an encrypted folder id list for your index
   - This may take some time. So, you can have a coffee until this finishes up
5. Get the folder id list by copying it to the clipboard or downloading it as a text file
6. Next, host that folder id list in a text file (publicly) on GitHub or somewhere else you prefer
   - GitHub is recommended
   - You can make the file available public since it is fully encrypted
   - Sample folder id list file can be found here: [goindex-extended/sample-files/sample-folder-id-list.txt](https://github.com/cheems/goindex-extended/blob/master/sample-files/sample-folder-id-list.txt)
7. Get the raw link to that file and put it in the index code: [9th line](https://github.com/cheems/goindex-extended/blob/master/index.js#L9)
   - CDN URLs can also be used (jsDeliver.com, raw.githack.com)
8. finally, redeploy the code; now search function will start working with folder Root type as well
